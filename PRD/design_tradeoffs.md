# Comparison of Intake

| Component | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|------|------|
| **Rubber Band** | • High grip and friction<br>• Inexpensive and easily replaceable<br>• Conforms to ball shapes well<br>• Excellent for passive intakes, launchers, and lifts ("free energy") | • Prone to snapping under high load<br>• Can wear out and lose elasticity over time<br>• Can get tangled in shafts and gears<br>- Less durable than other options |
| **Flex Wheel** | •Highly durable and less susceptible to snapping than rubber bands<br>• Available in different durometers (hardness) to fine-tune grip<br>• Consistent grip due to material properties | • Can become slick from dust, requiring cleaning with isopropyl alcohol<br>• Can be heavy, adding to robot weight<br>• Requires a hub for mounting <br> * difficult to conform to the ball shape |
| **Conveyor Belt** | • Excellent for high-volume intake and sorting<br>• Provides consistent and reliable long distance transport<br> | • Requires more space than other options<br> * Make needs to be cut to conform to the ball shape |


# Side of Scoring Mech

| Location | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|------|------|
| **Same as intake** | • auton scoring for middle goals<br> • storage place at the back<br> • descore mech can extend the same direction as the match loader<br> |* have to turn around to do match load <br>|
| **Opposite side** | • Match load efficient (doesn't need to turn around) <br> * when pushing other robot, no intake in the way| • Can't have cross bar at the back <br> • Not space efficent <br> • slow scoring for middle goal <br> * driver need to be trained to drive backwards |

# More design decisions
- Park or not
- Opponent balls hoard or not
- Lift or not (drive under the goal)
- intake up vs side
- auton middle vs long goal? Match load or not?
- long goal alignment or not?

# Tune details
- Match load
- Descore
- Intake system jam
- intake width, speed, height, funnel, ramp
